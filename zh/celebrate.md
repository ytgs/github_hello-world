# 完成了!



通过完成本课程，你已经学会了如何建立项目、在Github.com上完成拉拽请求（pull request）。

Here’s what you accomplished in this tutorial:

-    Created an open source repository
-    Started and managed a new branch
-    Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
-    Opened and merged a Pull Request

Take a look at your GitHub profile and you’ll see your new [contribution squares](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions)!

If you want to learn more about the power of Pull Requests, we recommend reading the [GitHub Flow Guide](http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/). You might also visit [GitHub Explore](http://github.com/explore) and get involved in an Open Source project :octocat:

>    Tip: Check out our other [Guides](http://guides.github.com/) and [YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/githubguides) for more GitHub how-tos.
