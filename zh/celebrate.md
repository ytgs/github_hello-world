# Celebrate!



By completing this tutorial, you’ve learned to create a project and make a pull request on GitHub! :tada: :octocat: :zap:

Here’s what you accomplished in this tutorial:

-    Created an open source repository
-    Started and managed a new branch
-    Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
-    Opened and merged a Pull Request

Take a look at your GitHub profile and you’ll see your new [contribution squares](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions)!

If you want to learn more about the power of Pull Requests, we recommend reading the [GitHub Flow Guide](http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/). You might also visit [GitHub Explore](http://github.com/explore) and get involved in an Open Source project :octocat:
