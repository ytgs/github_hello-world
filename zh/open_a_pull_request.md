# Open a Pull Request
# Step 4. Open a Pull Request

Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of ```master```, you can open a *pull request*.

Pull Requests 是GitHub中写作的核心. When you open a *pull request*, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show *diffs*, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub’s [@mention system](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/#text-formatting-toolbar) in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.
